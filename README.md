# index-html
An `index.html` file is the default or main webpage of a website. When you visit a website without specifying a particular page (like `example.com`), the web server typically looks for an `index.html` file in the website's root directory to display as the homepage.

### Key Points about `index.html`:

1. **Purpose**: 
   - Serves as the main entry point or homepage of a website.
   - Contains the structure and content that browsers render when visiting the site.

2. **Basic Structure**:
   - Consists of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which defines the content and layout.
   - Usually includes elements like `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, etc.

3. **Common Contents**:
   - Metadata (description, keywords, character set)
   - Links to CSS stylesheets for styling
   - Scripts for interactivity
   - Content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

4. **Example of a simple `index.html`:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Homepage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is the homepage served by index.html.</p>
    <a href="about.html">Learn more about us</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary:
- The `index.html` file is essential for defining the main webpage.
- It is automatically loaded by web servers when no specific filename is requested.
